# baseball_game_db
Final project for CS3140. Tasked with creating a medium sized relational database with a python frontend to query and edit the db. Took it upon myself to turn this project into a fun little game where the user is tasked with managing a professional baseball team in my fantasy league of 20 teams!

**CoPilot** is superior to *ChatGPT*. Like gah damn it can randomize like a pro!!!
